-------

This is a very simple demo of Opa. It just shows a header "Hello, world" and upon clicking the header it informs the user how many times it was cliked so far.

Compile and run with:

`opa hello-opa.opa --`

More about this example in Opa manual, chapter [A tour of Opa](http://doc.opalang.org/manual/A-tour-of-Opa).
